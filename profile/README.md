# MindPort GitHub Page

This is the home of the official VR Builder repos.

The following repos have public access:

- [VR-Builder](https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH/VR-Builder): This is the official VR Builder repository, matching the package found on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/vr-builder-open-source-toolkit-for-vr-creation-201913). Here you can download older releases or contribute to our open-source product.
- [VR-Builder-Community-Content](https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH/VR-Builder-Community-Content): This is meant to be a collection of tools from the community to the community. Here users can share their contributions more freely - for example, custom behaviors and conditions that are too situational to be in the core package, but could still be useful to someone. There are no package releases for this repo - just pull it inside your VR Builder project.
